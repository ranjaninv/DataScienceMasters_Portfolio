### Introduction

YouTube is an online video sharing and social media platform. It is the world’s second largest search engine and second most visited site after Google. In fact, 37% of all mobile internet traffic belongs to YouTube. It is the second most popular social media platform with almost 1.9bn users. YouTube has not only become a great alternative to traditional media but with billions of hours of content and countless number of corporations and groups, YouTube has also transformed into a tool for social impact. I looked for the trends in the data related to the uploaded videos US and see how various attributes are correlated. I also performed basic text analysis on ‘Description’ of the videos and build a word cloud to see which are most used words in the description of the uploaded videos. The idea is to build a model to predict the number of likes a video might get and another model to predict the number of views an uploaded video might get. This analysis and modeling are intended to help an influencer or content creator access their efforts effectively.

### Data Understanding

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
  
There are 29 decimal fields and 2 integer fields in the dataset.

The source dataset is clean and contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Hence, there wasn’t much scope with regards to data cleaning and preparation.

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

1. Distribution of fraudulent transactions amounts

2. Distribution of transaction times

3. Fraud vs Non-Fraud

### Modeling & Evaluation

1. Target variable is "Class", therefore classification model will be applied. 
2. In order to overcome the challenges with imbalanced dataset, we applied oversampling technique called SMOTE. 
3. Identified all the key features using SelectKBest
4. Compared the models based roc_auc score.

### Conclusion

1. As proven by SelectKBest, transaction time does not have any influence on prediction of fraudulent transaction.
2. SMOTE oversampling technique helped overcome the Imbalanced datasets challenge.
3. Using Random Forest Model our model will correctly predict if the transaction was fraudulent or not 98.528% of the time.
4. Logistic Regression Model our model will correctly predict if the transaction was fraudulent or not 98.032% of the time.
5. Random forest model has less false positives than logistic regression making it a better model.
