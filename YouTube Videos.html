<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>YouTube is an online video sharing and social media platform. It is the world’s second largest search engine and second most visited site after Google. In fact, 37% of all mobile internet traffic belongs to YouTube. It is the second most popular social media platform with almost 1.9bn users. YouTube has not only become a great alternative to traditional media but with billions of hours of content and countless number of corporations and groups, YouTube has also transformed into a tool for social impact. I looked for the trends in the data related to the uploaded videos US and see how various attributes are correlated. I also performed basic text analysis on ‘Description’ of the videos and build a word cloud to see which are most used words in the description of the uploaded videos. The idea is to build a model to predict the number of likes a video might get and another model to predict the number of views an uploaded video might get. This analysis and modeling are intended to help an influencer or content creator access their efforts effectively.</p>

<h3 id="modeling-evaluation">Modeling &amp; Evaluation</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>As part of modeling, the intent is to build a model to predict number of likes and number of views on a video. Since both these values are continuous variables, therefore regression models are to be applied.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Results of linear Regression to predict number of likes. </p>

</li>
<li><p>Linear regression results shows that r-squared score of 0.76 which is not accurate enough. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Random Forest Regressor model to predict number of views has a mean absolute error (MAE) of 220924 and score of 0.985.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ol>
<li>Linear Regression is a good fit when modeling to predict number of likes.</li>
<li>To predict the number of views, Random Forest Regressor has better score than linear regression. </li>
<li>Positive correlation between the number of views and the number of likes of a video. Like wise is the case with the number of views and the no of comments on a video.</li>
<li>The data set I worked with could have had few more attributes such comment text, length of the video, number of subscribers, etc. </li>
